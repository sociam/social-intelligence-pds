The Future of Social is Personal:
The Role of Personal Data Stores in Social Interfaces 

Max Van Kleek, Kieron O’Hara

Introduction

A key characteristic common to the various kinds of "social intelligence" described in this volume is one of enhanced autonomy through technological support.  Such autonomy allows constituents of a society to dynamically form new connections with others as needed, promoting a more adaptive, flexible and robust social fabric than those of traditional structures, in which efficiency lead a majority to rely on a handful of central, fixed intermediaries.  

While we see technology being applied in many ways to support the kind of autonomy thus described, personal information environments is one area where it has, thus far, been used to drive a reversal in such trends, towards more centralisation. Currently, a handful of dominant platform vendors and application service providers are grappling for control over individuals' personal information archives, trying to accumulate as many users as possible before the others. This trend as business model began with the rise of so-called "Web 2.0", the second phase of the Web which marked by the mass generation and sharing of user-generated content; content that started with a few social network profiles and blog posts, but gradually grew to encompass the entirity of personal data people keep, from files and docuemnts to film and music archives. Thus began a migration of personal digital artefacts off the individually-administered personal computers into various information spaces of the web.  

This process has recently started to accelerate significantly, as platform vendors have begun to provide software that deeply integrates into the personal computing platforms and devices people use, from Facebook "Home screen" integration on mobile phones to operating-system level integration of Windows Skydrive and Apple's iCloud.  Such services extend the reach of Web services into the intimate digital spaces of one's personal digital devices, so that these services might manage this data as well.

What are the implications of this centralisation?  Although the full consequences may not yet not be fully understood, a few are readily identifiable.  First, such delegation necessitates relinquishing some degree of control over various aspects of how this data is handled and controlled, ranging from how it is stored and represented, to how (and when) it can be accessed, as well as who has access to it.  Perhaps more significantly, it has profound implications on the future accessibility and preservation of this information, as many commodity service providers offer no longitduinal durability or accessibility guarantee for users' data- nor, in fact, any guarantees pertaining to its security.

Of greater concern is the forefeiture of rights to ownership and use of the data that come with the terms of use of some of these platforms, or conversely, the implicit granting of rights to use this personal information by these third parties. The latter are present in nearly all "free" cloud hosting providers, as the core means of deriving revenue. In these systems, personal user data creates value that sustains platforms; thus platforms are incentivised to try to attract and retain users long as possible.  In other words, platforms are incentivised to create a dependency environemnt in which they serve as the central common infrastructure.

In this chapter, we contemplate a socio-technological solution to give end-user individuals back their autonomy through technological capacity to once again act as the data controllers of their personal information environments.  We first examine the needs for what such a platform through insights from the field of Personal Information Management (PIM).  Second, we conduct an analysis of existing technical platforms  that have been introduced towards meeting hese needs.  Finally, the chapter concludes with a discussion of how these platforms may change the socio-economic landscape of the Web, and the ways personal data is shared, collected and handled.

What is a Personal Data Store ?

We begin with an abstract characterisation of what a technical capability for achieving the aforementioned goal, adopting the term  \emph{personal data store} (PDS) from the Vendor Relationship Management community \cite{vrm} to refer to this collective capability. (The use of PDS in the singular is not intended to imply such a system would have to be a monolithic system, but might be realised through several or many disparate systems providing support).

In order for individuals to fundamentally maintain their information over the long term, a PDS must facilitate the maintance and keeping of such data. Thus, we arrive at the following first definition of a PDS.

	A personal data store is a platform or service that allows individuals to manage and maintain their digital information, artefacts and assets, longitudinally, fully, and self-sufficiently, so it may be used practically when and where it is needed, without relying on external third parties. 

This description leaves undefined the kinds of activities that might constitute "manage", "maintain", "control fully" or "use" this information, nor even what kind(s) of information we are talking about.  In order to approach a requirements analysis, thus, we must futher identify the kinds of information that such a store might handle, and the specific kinds of activities that constitute "manage" "maintaining" and "using" them. 

Fortunately, extensive studies within the field of information science and human computer interaction (HCI), particularly the research field of Personal Information Management (PIM) have studied the ways people find, keep, store, manage, retrieve and use information using both physical and digital tools.  From this we refine our characterisation of PDSes.

What Constitutes Personal Digital Information?

Data Ownership



In order to understand what personal data stores might be 

 the implications of what such a shift might have for individuals, the ways they interact with one another, as well as third parties.   at an approach to giving individuals significantly enhanced longitudinal data management capabilities on various personal digital devices that they can own or control.  Central to our discussion is the notion of a Personal Data Store (PDS), which we will describe by first understanding the needs and requirements 

 towards giving end-user individuals the ability through an examination of the social, economic and cognitive needs surrounding personal information management.

This outsouricng which contrasts with many other kinds of valuable goods -- and is historically unprecedented  (?).   describe briefly how this came about not technically but due to the economic forces during the evolution of the Web and computing in general, simultaneously across sectors spanning direct marketing, credit profiling/finance, and finally, internet advertising-driven platforms .
	personal information is quickly becoming among individuals’ most valuable assets [Odom et al, 2013 ]
	incentive misalignment - the pervasive information brokers on the Web  have the incentives to use individuals’ personal information to profit, and incentivise individuals to use them by offering free services.  the priority for individuals however is to keep secure, safe, while engaging socially with others and having ‘fun’.  
the implications of this misalignment for individuals , while only visible thus far in a handful of  “incidents” resulting from the perception of breach of personal privacy due to the actions benefitting the brokers at hand, extend  to uncertainty as the quantity and quality (fidelity and completeness) of these data continues to increase exponentially

Personal Data Stores 
The notion of a personal data store is simply shifting responsibilities of data brokerage and management  to the end-user citizen(s) who “own” the data, to whom the data is most valuable. 

**(Kieron)** useful definition of the ideal functionality of PDSs from Ctrl-Shift a while ago which we might plagiarise or even critique, depending on how much of it we want to use. So, according to them, a PDS user can:
1. manage their personal info
2. create an integrated view of their activities
3. verify identity
4. share data selectively
5. better manage info as a tool
6. use analytics to spot trends
7. communicate and share opinions
8. set priorities and planning for life events
Now, I think that’s a pretty good list, but also your paper on the topic - was it the Indx paper? - I thought had an excellent discussion of the desiderata for a PDS.

**(Kieron)** OK, we should keep “own” in inverted commas. We should focus on three types of data that emerge from our online stuff: volunteered data (preferences, recommendations, friendships), observed or tracked data (downloads, browser history, location, health devices) and inferred data (credit scores, terrorist profiles, data mining). We have different intuitions, I think, about what our relationships should be to these types of data. In particular, the inferred data is (a) the result of some intellectual effort by someone other than ourselves, and (b) usually inferred from data about lots of people, not just me. So that is somewhat more remote from us, and is also created by someone at a cost to themselves. On the other hand, it may also have important effects upon us. So “ownership” is a difficult concept here (and in a literal sense we don’t own the data of which we are the subject, unless we create it ourselves using our own systems).

Value is an important concept. What we can see PDSs as doing is rebalancing the value proposition here, so that at the moment, our data (data of which we are the subject) is of value to corporations or governments, who may, if they decide, create services defined by them which also provide a bit of value to us. PDSs give us the potential for more control of the value chain, whoever owns the data.

Re ownership of data, we can go into that in as much detail as you think appropriate, but the Midata stuff is a good place to start as an example of the advantages and difficulties of returning “our” data to ourselves.
	
Privacy and autonomy: one strong claim about PDSs is that they allow informational self-determination. They make the trade-offs clearer, and give a stronger sense of whether, e.g., one wants to show one’s location in order to access a web service, or whether one wants to reveal one’s age (in a verifiable way) to get a drink.

Nevertheless, the collection and curation of this data involves creating a resource of great value to many other people, not least governments. There will be attempts to get at this data, either by providing incentives (which might be financial, or may be in kind), or by force of law. So, for instance, your network of friends is a very good predictor of your credit risk - loan companies (in the news today, of course) will soon be offering cheaper loans to those who hand over access to their network.

Furthermore, good curation of data can often stand in the way of privacy anyway - for instance, one way of preserving privacy involves perturbing data. But good practice in recording provenance makes that harder.

So, PDSs might contribute to a small extent to one of the problems they are trying to solve. This might lead us to think about whether we might address this from the inside - are there privacy-by-design approaches that might help here?

Reminder - PbD is often accompanied by hand-waving, but we can nail it down a little more firmly by focusing on 7 principles:
1. Proactive and preventative, not reactive and remedial
2. Privacy as default
3. Privacy embedded in design, not a bolt-on after vulnerabilities spotted
4. Privacy as positive sum opportunity, not a zero-sum compromise
5. Full lifecycle security
6. Transparency
7. User-centric design

Need for clear roles and rights for PDS users, and their business partners and trusted interactions. Clear set of obligations to anyone using the information. May revisit Novotny & Spiekermann’s 3 layer model for setting these out.

Jones’s 6 Types of Personal Information [p, 34, Keeping Found Things Found]

1. Owned/controlled by me		Email, files on our computers
2.About me				Credit/medical history, web history
3.Directed towards me		Phone calls, drop ins, adverts, popups
4.Sent (provided) by me		Emails, tweets, published reports 
5. Experienced by me		Pages, papers, articles I’ve read
6. Relevant (useful) to me		Somewhere “out there” is the perfect vacation, house, job, lifelong mate

Fundamental units of personal information
Jones defines an information item to be a useful unit of discussing the individual elements that comprise our personal information.

An information item is a packaging of information. Examples of information items include (1) paper documents, (2) electronic documents, digital photographs, digital music, digital film, and other files, (3) email messages, (4) web pages, and (5) references (e.g., shortcuts, aliases) to any of the above. Items encapsulate information in a persistent form that can be created, modified, stored, retrieved, given a name, tags, and other properties, moved, copied, distributed, deleted, and otherwise manipulated. An information item has an associated information form that is determined by the tools and applications that support these operations. Common forms of information include paper documents, e-documents and other files, email messages, and web bookmarks. (p 37, Jones, 2001)

This definition fundamentally assumes that personal information environments can be considered comprised of discrete individual elements rather than a continuum.  Just as matter can be viewed as comprised of “continuous” macroscopic entities, but at the same time be comprised of discrete individual atoms, we think that being able to discuss personal information in terms of abstract collections of information at a macroscopic level is well complemented with a model consisting of the granular items that express the ways this information is recorded and stored.  (Indeed, the analogy is useful even continuing to the sub-atomic level, consisting of components of individual information items, as well shall discuss later)

Characterising information items 
Information items can come in many shapes, representations and forms, with some items being characteristically more similar in structure than others.  To reflect this, various researchers have derived various kinds of classifications of kinds of information items.  Jones uses what he calls information forms, which he defines in terms of both its internal structure and a common set of tools typically used to manipulate and create these information items.
