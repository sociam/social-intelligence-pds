\title{The Future of Social is Personal: The Role of Personal Data Stores in Social Interfaces}

% by Max Van Kleek, Kieron O’Hara

\maketitle

\section{Introduction}

A key characteristic common to the various kinds of ``social intelligence'' described in this volume is one of enhanced autonomy through technological support.  Such autonomy allows constituents of a society to dynamically form new connections with others as needed, promoting a more adaptive, flexible and robust social fabric than those of traditional structures, in which efficiency lead a majority to rely on a handful of central, fixed intermediaries.  

While we see technology being applied in many ways to support the kind of autonomy thus described, personal information environments is one area where it has, thus far, been used to drive a reversal in such trends, towards more centralisation. Currently, a handful of dominant platform vendors and application service providers are grappling for control over individuals' personal information archives, trying to accumulate as many users as possible before the others. This trend as business model began with the rise of so-called ``Web 2.0'', in which sites became sophisticated apps and content-management platforms designed to facilitate the creation and sharing of user-generated data and content; content that started with a few social network profiles and blog posts, but gradually grew to encompass the entirety of personal data people keep, from files and documents to film and music archives. Thus began a migration of personal digital artefacts off the individually-administered personal computers into various information spaces of the web.  The assimilation of personal data off personal digital devices has accelerated particularly recently, as Web application and service providers have started to create deep integrations with personal computing devices with examples such as Facebook Home\cite{facebook}, Windows Skydrive\cite{skydrive} and Apple's iCloud\cite{icloud}, respectively. Such services have extended the reach of Web services into the intimate digital spaces of one's personal digital devices, offering backup and management services for these private data collections as well.

What are the implications of this centralisation?  Although the ultimate, long-term implications of this shift are not yet fully understood, several immediate consequences are apparent. Fundamentally, the delegation of responsibility of managing one's personal information to third party service providers necessitates relinquishing control over various aspects of how these data are handled and controlled, ranging from how they are stored and represented, to how (and when) they can be accessed, as well as to whom access is granted.  When such third party delegation is done in the context of the increasingly pervasive business model of deriving sustaining revenue directly from these data themselves (through targeted advertising or licensing to third parties), platforms are essentially incentivised to collect from as many individuals as possible, and to create an experience or mechanism that further retains them as long as possible.

While this mechanism has thus far been hugely successful at creating extremely profitable services of the likes of Facebook, Twitter, Twitter and Google, the result has been an increasingly fragile ecosystem in which a majority of Web users have come to rely on a handful of service platforms, which are, in turn amassing a disproportionate quantity of users' personal information.  This centralisation has occurring not just for Web users from the United States, where most of these services are based, but internationally as well, raising concerns pertaining to each country's sovereign rights of access to data of its own versus other nations' citizens, as well as issues pertaining to compliance and enforcement of data protection laws across international boundaries \cite{internationalownership}. Moreover, the fact that these platforms are incentivised to get users to disclose as much of their information as possible has led to an artificial forced tradeoff between participation and privacy; in order to enjoy the most basic features of the Web, they have to \emph{give their data away}, thereby sacrificing control over their data and potentially their privacy.

This misalignment of incentives between \emph{what users want to do with their data} and \emph{what platform providers want to do with their data} has the potential to destructively interfere with development of context-sensitive applications that promise more effective, personalised, behavioural-adaptive applications that rely on richer and more sensitive data models, due to either actual or perceived privacy risks entailed.  Moreover, the dependency relationships that result from this process places unprecedented power in the hands of these companies, leaving individuals fundamentally powerless towards effectively switching to alternative providers in the long term; the result of this is an overall reduction of autonomy and mobility, potentially ultimately leading to increased fragility, fragmented data spaces and lost or forgotten data\cite{lostlegacy}.

However, a basic assumption that powers this dependence is the disparity between the data management capabilities held by the end-users of the Web from those that provide the hosting and storage. In this chapter, we question this ``thin client'' model of Web computing by proposing a way that better data management capabilities might be re-introduced directly within the devices they own and control, to allow users to retain control over their data while supporting the same social, dynamic interaction flows they have come to experience on the Web. This set of capabilities we refer to as \emph{personal data stores},  capabilities to put fundamental data storage, hosting, and sharing capabilities at the end user individual, so that these vital facilities can follow users as they interact with one another and third party individuals.  We first examine the needs for what such a platform through insights from the field of Personal Information Management (PIM).  Second, we conduct an analysis of existing technical platforms  that have been introduced towards meeting these needs.  Finally, the chapter concludes with a discussion of how these platforms may change the socio-economic landscape of the Web, and the ways personal data is shared, collected and handled.

\section{What is a Personal Data Store?}

We begin with an abstract characterisation of what a technical capability for achieving the aforementioned goal, adopting the term  \emph{personal data store} (PDS) from the Vendor Relationship Management community \cite{vrm} to refer to this collective capability. (The use of PDS in the singular is not intended to imply such a system would have to be a monolithic system, but might be realised through several or many disparate systems providing support).

In order for individuals to fundamentally maintain their information over the long term, a PDS must facilitate the maintance and keeping of such data. Thus, we arrive at the following first definition of a PDS.

\begin{quote}

	A personal data store is a platform or service that allows individuals to manage and maintain their digital information, artefacts and assets, longitudinally, fully, and self-sufficiently, so it may be used practically when and where it is needed, without relying on external third parties. 

\end{quote}

This description leaves undefined the kinds of activities that might constitute ``manage'', ``maintain'', ``control fully'' or ``use'' this information, nor even what kind(s) of information we are talking about.  In order to approach a requirements analysis, thus, we must further identify the kinds of information that such a store might handle, and the specific kinds of activities that constitute ``manage'' ``maintaining'' and ``using'' them. 

Fortunately, studies of information science and human computer interaction (HCI), particularly the research field of Personal Information Management (PIM), have worked to document the ways individuals work with, and manage the information in their lives, both in personal and work contexts.  We thus propose that work on PDSes should be informed thoroughly by this literature, specifically in scoping \emph{what} PDSes might do and further \emph{how} they best do it.


\section{Defining Personal Data}

The task of identifying the \emph{kinds of data} a person might need to keep, manage and use is a complex and daunting task.  Researchers in PIM have derived various working definitions of \emph{personal information} in order to effectively scope their field of study, and and have made progress towards potential functional classifications for kinds of personal information. One such classification by Jones et al. from \cite{kftf} is visible in Figure\ref{fig:jonestype}.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{p{4cm} p{8cm}} 
Category & Examples \\
1. Owned/controlled by me & e.g., Email, files on our computers  \\
2. About me	& e.g., my credit/medical history, web history \\
3. Directed towards me & e.g., phone calls, drop ins, adverts, popups \\
4. Sent (provided) by me & e.g.,  Emails, tweets, published reports  \\
5. Experienced by me & e.g.,  Pages, papers, articles I’ve read \\
6. Relevant (useful) to me	& e.g.,  Somewhere ``out there'' is the perfect vacation, house, job, lifelong mate \\
\end{tabular}
\caption{Jones's 6 Types of Personal Information, from \cite{kftf}}
\label{fig:jonestype}
\end{table}

Jones takes an approach that distingushes among different kinds of information by how it relates to the individual in question; whether the individual experienced it, kept it, sent it, or received it, or whether this information refers to the individual or his or her activities.  The categories \emph{About me} and \emph{Relevant to me} are controversial because these definitions do not require individuals to be aware of the existence of the information; it thus establishes a sphere that goes beyond the scope of information experienced by the user.  We discuss the potential implications of including such information within the scope of PDSes in \emph{attentional challenges}. 

\subsection{The Shape of Personal Data}

% At a lower level of detail, then, one might ask about the data model, its shape and, finally, its representation.  For this purpose, Jones introduces the notion of \emph{information forms} defined in terms of the tools used to manage them; e-mail is a single form because it is almost always accessed through an e-mail client, files though file management tools, blog entries using content management services (CMS) and so forth.  While this approach was well suited to the era of when apps defined singular data types, over time, as tools have become more sophisticated, they have become increasingly able to handle more diverse and complex kinds of information.  Perhaps more importantly, since virtually all information accessed through the Web is through the singular tool of the web browser, making discinctions by which tool is used to access the data is no longer possible .

While this approach may have worked well in the era when apps defined singular data types, over time, as tools have become more sophisticated, they have individually become  able to handle more diverse and complex kinds of information.  Perhaps more importantly, with the rise of Web-based tools, since all information is accessed through the singular tool of a Web browser, with data often spanning multiple sites and pages, such distinctions are difficult to draw.

A slightly different approach is to classify personal data by the data models and data schemas used.  Since personal data can be derived from practically any application, they may be derived from fundamentally heterogeneous data models (e.g., network, relational, object-oriented, document, etc). Similarly, the source(s) may take any potential source schema.  This means that PDSes must inherently address diversity at two levels, that of the fundamental data model, and that of the schema.

\subsection{The Activities Around Personal Information}

To begin, we describe a few scenarios to illustrate the ways PDSes could impact the personal information management practices of individuals, towards greater autonomypotential for such capabilities towards supporting important information management  might solve significant data management problems by giving individuals control over the storage of their data.

An additional requirement arises if PDSes are to present a unified, consolidated view of the user's data derived from multiple, heterogeneous data sources. Doing so requires addressing the challenge of reconciling heterogeneity.  This is particularly critical as inconsistencies arising from data model heterogeneity can easily confuse users people and greatly increase the complexity of system use (e.g. \cite{})

Finally, most data formats are not ``future-proof'' in the sense that they are not an open format that

While personal backup appliances such as ioSafe, WD My CLoud, and Apple's Time Machine have aimed at providing self-hosted data management encapsulated in simple ``plug and play'' data appliances for the home, adoption of even rudimentary home backup solutions remains low. Although current estimates are poor, it is thought that 10\% of individuals effectively regularly back up their home computers, with the majority backing up only ``periodically''
